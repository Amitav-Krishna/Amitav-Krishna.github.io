        When you look at ants, you might not think theyâ€™re very intelligent.<br> However, ants build massive colonies spanning many miles, and wage brutal wars against other colonies.<br> The backbone to their success is their intricate system of communication.<br> In this blog post, I will tell you about just how complicated formic communication is.

    </p>
    <p>
       The first type of formic communication and the most well known one are pheromones.<br> Pheromones are secreted or excreted chemicals released by ants (and other insects) that can communicate lots of different things.<br> Other ants pick up these pheromones using their antenna.<br> Alarm pheromones can be used when an ant colony is being invaded, while trail pheromones are used to communicate the location of food.<br> Pheromones are also used to identify different ants.<br> They can be used to distinguish different types of ant (Soldiers vs. Workers) or different colonies (Friend vs. Foe).<br> Even though this is a very reliable system, it is still failable.<br> Ant death mills happen when ants are following each other, and the ant at the front has to make a slight deviation from its path (Such as to avoid a rock).<br> When this happens, this can lead to the ants going around in circles, following the pheromones, until they die from exhaustion.<br><br>
        While pheromone communication makes up the bulk of ant communication, there are other methods of communication.<br> Ants also communicate through touching. For the longest time we believed that antennae were only used as a sensory organ, however a study from the University of Melbourne revealed that antennae were two-way communicators.<br> Cuticular hydro-carbons (CHCs) are a chemical that covers the body of an ant (as well as other insects such as bees and flies).<br> It was originally thought that the use of CHCs were just to keep the animals from dehydration, however now we know that they are also essential to ant communication.<br> When researchers removed the CHCs from the antennae, her opponents could not recognise her colony identity.<br> There was also a famous experiment 125 years ago by entomologist Auguste Forel where he completely removed the antennae of 4 different species of ants.<br> Instead of fighting each other, they simply huddled together peacefully.<br><br>
