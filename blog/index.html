        When you look at ants, you might not think theyâ€™re very intelligent.<br> However, ants build massive colonies spanning many miles, and wage brutal wars against other colonies.<br> The backbone to their success is their complicated system of communication.<br> In this blog post, I will tell you about just how complicated formic communication is.

    </p>
    <p>
       The first type of formic communication and the most well known one are pheromones.<br> Pheromones are secreted or excreted chemicals released by ants (and other insects) that can communicate lots of different things.<br> Other ants pick up these pheromones using their antenna.<br> Alarm pheromones can be used when an ant colony is being invaded, while trail pheromones are used to communicate the location of food.<br> Pheromones are also used to identify different ants.<br> They can be used to distinguish different types of ant (Soldiers vs. Workers) or different colonies (Friend vs. Foe).<br> Even though this is a very reliable system, it is still failable.<br> Ant death mills happen when ants are following each other, and the ant at the front has to make a slight deviation from its path (Such as to avoid a rock).<br> When this happens, this can lead to the ants going around in circles, following the pheromones, until they die from exhaustion.
