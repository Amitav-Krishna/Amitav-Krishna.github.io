<p>How long does it take to mow a field? This may seem like a very simple question, but we must consider humanityy greastest invention, teamwork. How long will it take two people to mow the same field? That's waht I will tell you tgoday. asdfjoqw3ijpofadff sd   dsf  First let's introduce the cast.

The first lawnmower we will disc8ss is Bob. Bobb is a relatively new lawnmower, and as such can onlt6y mow a fiedld every hour. The other person we eill consider is jeffery. Jeffery is a veternan lawnmower. He waw one of the first people to acopt the ouse of a lawnmower, and was personal freieends with the inven tor of the lawnmower, John L. Mower. Let's cnow consider the math b ehing how long it will take them to mow a field.

The Impow5tant thing to consitder azbout thwis problem is that this is a probnlem about speed. Whay speed is equsalt to distanc4e divided by time. Bob's sepeed is 1 field per hour, while jeffery's speed is 2 fields fper hour. This means that togerther they can mow theree field s per hour. this means that in order to mow one filed, we havie to divide both sided by 3, whichg mneans that togerther they can mow 1 vield in 1 hour divided by6 three, or 20 minutes. </p>
