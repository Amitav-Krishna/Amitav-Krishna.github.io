  <p>Why do people worship and pray? Does it give them hope, or a scapegoat? What are the biological and sociological reasons and impact of religion, and is religion helpful, or is it an outdated ideology?

Religion gives people a common ground, and encourages socialization. It gives people comfort, and it gives people answers to questions that science struggles to answer. What happens after death, where do we come from, why do we exist? It gives people hope in a world that can be extremely cruel and unforgiving. It can also drive positive change. Religious beliefs motivated Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights activists to risk their
