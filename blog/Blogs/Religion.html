  <p><em>This was an essay I wrote a few months ago. This content may be slightly insulting for some readers.</em><br><br>Why do people worship and pray? Does it give them hope, or a scapegoat? What are the biological and sociological reasons and impact of religion, and is religion helpful, or is it an outdated ideology? In this piece, I will tell you about the history of religion, its benefits and detriments. I will show you why, in the end, religion is ultimately beneficial to society.</p>

  <p>The history of religion is hard to pin down exactly. The earliest archeological evidence for religion is in the Middle and Lower Paleolithic era, with some interpreting the burial of some Homo Sapiens, Homo Neandrethalis, and Homo Naledi nearly 300,000 years ago as evidence of religion, as well as symbolic items from the Middle Stone age site in Africa, however these are highly debated. Other archeological evidence from more recent times is less debated. Things such as the Löwenmensch figure from about 30,000 years ago and the Venus Figurines from between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago are less debated. The oldest believed religious site is known as Göbekli Tepe, with abstract and animal reliefs carved into it, it is believed to have been constructed just before the Neolithic revolution. The oldest religious texts are believed to be the Pyramid Texts from around 2400 BCE. The largest modern day religions are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Christianity and Islam mostly spread due to multiple conquests and crusades to convert others, while Buddhism spread mostly through the Silk Road. Hinduism is believed to be the oldest religion, dating back almost 4,000 years.</p>

  <p>Discussing just the history of religion, and not its present-day impacts is like discussing just the football field and not the players. There are many benefits to religion. Religion gives people a common ground, and encourages socialization. It gives people comfort, and it gives people answers to questions that science struggles to answer. What happens after death, where do we come from, why do we exist? It gives people hope in a world that can be extremely cruel and unforgiving. It can also drive positive change. Religious beliefs motivated Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights activists to risk their lives to desegregate the south. <br><br> However, even though there are many benefits to religion, there are also quite a few detriments. It can cause people to be content with where they are. Philosopher Carl Marx called religion “The opiate of the masses''. Many in poverty either take it as a test of faith, or take it as some kind of retribution for some kind of past act. Religion can also strengthen negative gender stereotypes. A study conducted in 2013 by Klingorova, Kamila, and Havlicek found that states with little to no religious affiliation had the lowest levels of gender discrimination, states with Christian or Buddhist affiliations had average levels of gender discrimination, while states with Islam or Hindu affiliation had the highest levels of gender discrimination. Many religions prevent women from becoming clergy and deny access to religious sites while menstruating. Similarly, many people use religious scriptures as an excuse to deny people from the LGBTQ+ community things such as wedding cakes and marriage licences. Religion is used as an excuse to genocide and colonise other religions. From the Muslims who eradicated those who would not swear allegiance to Allah, to the 9 Crusades, to the Christians eradicating cultures, languages, and religions to spread the word of Jesus Christ. There are hundreds of examples of religion being used to justify horrible atrocities. In the 1990s, there was a sexual abuse scandal in Canada, the US, and many other nations dating back to at least the 1960s. There were an unknown number of children who were abused by deacons, nuns, and priests. Catholics had too much trust in the church, along with a lack of information around sexual abuse, let the cycle to continue. The Church did nothing to stop this abuse, instead moving the accused to different parishes. Victims began to speak out, empowering others to share their experiences. At least 5100 hundred priests had partaken in this abuse, most being defrocked. However, there are still concerns that there are still about 2000 priests who were never prosecuted.<br><br>Religion has existed for hundreds of thousands of years. Religion acts as a beacon to unite people and give people hope. Meanwhile, religion has also systematically oppressed and sedated people for centuries. In the end, I believe that while religion has been used for awful things, it is still a core piece of our society.    Religion is what motivates many people to endure the world, and while I do not believe in religion, it is still extremely important for many people. I believe (Ha!) religion is ultimately beneficial to our society as a whole.</p>
