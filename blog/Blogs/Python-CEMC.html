    <h2 class="sub-header">Introduction</h2>
    <p>I recently came across an interesting math problem. In it, you had to find out how many numbers fit a bunch of different criteria. I decided that it would be more fun to write a program in Python, so here we are. This problem was the <a href="https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Problem of the week from CEMC</a>. The specifics of the problem are as follows:</p>
    <p><em>Adrian has a few favourite numbers. In order to help people understand, he created a list of all the criteria: 
            <ul>
              <li>Must have 5 digits</li>
              <li>Must not have any even digits or repeated digits</li>
              <li>1 000s digit must be greater than 10 000s digit and 100s digit</li>
              <li>10s digit must be greater than 100s digit and unit digit</li>
</em>

  <h2 class="sub-header"> Approaching the problem</h2> <ul> <li>We know that this problem is asking us to go through every digit between 10 000 and 99 999, so that part should be simple. A <em>for</em> loop is what I’m using</li><li>There are 5 things we need to test for: <em> No even digits, no repeated digits, the 1 000s digit must be greater than the adjacent digits, as well as the same thing for the 10s digit.</em></li><li>Finally, we just need to use a <em>print()</em> statement to output the answer.</li>
  <h2 class="sub-header">The Setup</h2><p>In programming, variables are essential for pretty much anything. You can imagine a variable as a box that holds a certain value. You can change the value inside the variable or you can use it for whatever purpose you want. For this program I had 2 variables outside of the for loop so that they didn’t reset for every number, favourites and numFavourites; favourites is a list that stores every one of Adrian’s favourite digits, while numFavourites stores the number of favourite numbers. Inside the loop I had 4 more variables: placeholder, we’ll get to its use later, digits, a list that will store all 5 digits of the number, numStr, the number converted to the string type (text), and isFavourite, a boolean (A true or false) that’s used to store whether or not a number is Adrian’s favourite.</p>
