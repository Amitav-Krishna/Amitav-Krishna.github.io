    <p><em>"Ants are not only efficient, they are hardworking and thrifty, qualities which have always seemed like good reasons for seeing them as virtuous role models"<br> - William Norton Wheeler</em></p>
    <p>Deep in the jungle lie some of the most advanced insects in the world, their complexity second only to our own. With expansive colonies, highways stretching for almost 500 metre in either direction, gardens used to cultivate nutrient rich fungus. In this blog we’ll discuss the ants that forage in the forest, the ants that maintain the colonies, and the ants that strike out on their own to start a new colony.
</p>
    
    <p></p>An ant wakes up and leaves the nest to go forage. The time that the ants go foraging depends on the nest, some are diurnal (Awake during the day), others are nocturnal (Awake during the night) in order to avoid the parasitic flies that normally leech off the leaves they carry back, while others forage during both. Before we continue, let’s address the ant caste system. There are three types of leafcutter workers: Minims, Medias, and Majors. Minims usually work either at the nest tending to the gardens or eggs, or clearing the trail, or hitchhiking on ants carrying leaves back to the nest in order to defend from parasitic flies and begin the leaf cleaning process (They also do the unusual jobs such as waste management). The Medias are generally the ones that harvest the leaves and process them inside the nest. Finally, the Majors appear to maintain and develop trails, defend foragers from attackers, and occasionally carry larger forage (such as fruit). Trails are usually built to speed up travel to frequent foraging spots.  Once the leaf has been taken, it is usually given to someone else to carry back (If they are on a tree trunk it’s usually mandible to mandible, or else if they’re near the base of the tree the ant at the top might drop to save the effort of having to climb down. After the leaf has been carried back to the nest, it’s now the responsibility of the ants at the nest.
</p>
    
    <p>At the nest, the majority of the work is done by the minims. The bulk of the leaf cutter’s diet is derived from a specialised fungus known as Leucoagaricus gongylophorus (Try saying that 5 times fast). The ants eat the fungus’s gongylidia (Tiny bulbous tip structures that are filled) and feed the liquids to their larvae (It’s important to note that while larvae are dependent on the liquids, workers occasionally eat other things such as fruit). The fungus is almost completely dependent on the ant, as the fungus has lost its ability to emit spores. The ants fertilise the fungus using the leaf cuttings and its faecal matter (poop), and also produces a bacteria, Pseudonocardia, that coats the fungus and provides antibodies against mycoparasitic microfungi (Really small fungi that parasitise the fungus). There are also ants who take care of waste, they are usually older workers and they remove waste from the fungal gardens to prevent the spread of pathogens. After they become garbage collectors, they are never allowed to interact with the fungus or with the queen. Now that we’ve talked about the day to day activities of the colony, let’s talk about how they get started.

</p>
    
    <p>In an ant colony the vast majority of ants, all of the workers, are sterile. There are only a few thousand winged queens(I said ‘only’ a few thousand because the average colony has around 8 million ants). Every year, winged females and males mate and then disperse to found new colonies. In these mating flights multiple males mate with the one female, usually in cases like this the sperm from the different males would compete with each other, however the queen can stop this competition. The queen is very efficient with the sperm, needing only 1 or 2 sperm to fertilise an egg, compared to humans who usually use about 200 million sperm to fertilise an egg. When the queens leave the nest, they take a little bit of the fungus’s mycelium (Mycelia is basically the body of the fungus) in their infra buccal pocket (A little cavity below the oesophagus). When they find a place to make their colony, the queen digs out a nest chamber and plants the fungus (Can you plant a fungus?). For the first week or so, the queen fertilises the fungus using her faecal matter (poop) and eggs, and survives on her body fat and her wing tissue, which she reabsorbs. Because of the queen being the mother of all of the ants, this means that an ant scant sneak a glance at their ant ( And, there’s my daily pun.). 	

</p>
    
    <p>So now you’ve hopefully learned a bit about the leaf-cutter ant. If you want to know about how these ants communicate, I have an entire <a href = "/blog/Blogs/ant-communication">blog</a> about that. Remember, I’ve been Amitav Krishna, and I’m going to go to bed now.
