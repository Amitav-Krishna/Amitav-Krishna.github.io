    <p>Black holes are the strangest things in our universe. Formed from the death of a star, the laws of physics break down inside its inescapable border. Black holes are the most extreme things in our universe, being able to do things we thought were impossible. In this essay, I will discuss the birth of black holes, the strange physics of a black hole, and how we could use them to create the largest power source in the universe.</p>
    
    <p>The core of every star is under unbelievable pressure. In these extreme conditions, the star begins to combine hydrogen into helium. This fusion creates energy that pushes back the outside layer, as well as releasing energy that we perceive as heat and light. After it has used up all of the hydrogen, it begins to fuse helium. However the outward energy released when fusing helium is much less. In smaller stars like our star, it shrinks and turns into a white dwarf. In supermassive stars however, a battle goes on between gravity and the core of the star. If the core wins, then the star turns into a neutron star, the densest thing in the universe apart from black holes. If gravity wins however, the star turns into a black hole. There is also one other way. When two neutron stars orbit each other and eventually collide. This collision is so violent that it can cause a black hole to form. While going over the birth of a black hole is important to understanding its bizarre physics, only talking about the birth of a black hole and not about the black hole itself is like only talking about the field and not the players.</p>
    
    <p>The reason black holes are black is due to the fact that light cannot escape. In the centre of every black hole is something known as a singularity. At first we believed a singularity was zero dimensional; however we failed to consider that black holes spin. Every star has a rotation, and when you reduce the size of an object, its rotational energy increases. This means that it is one dimensional, having a circumference, but lacking depth and width in the traditional sense. It is important to note that our understanding of black holes is very limited and potentially wrong, as by their very nature they violate all of our laws of physics.</p>
    
    <p>There is a way we could extract nearly unlimited amounts from a black hole. Kerr black holes have a special zone called the ergosphere. Inside the ergosphere, in order to stay still you would have to be moving faster than the speed of light (Impossible!). However, the ergosphere is still outside of the event horizon, meaning that an object can still escape. Through something known as the Penrose Process, an object can “steal” some of the black hole’s rotational energy. Think of it like being in a whirlpool and instead of resisting the whirlpool, swimming along with it to gain some rotational energy. By launching an object into an ergosphere, and then splitting it in two, one of the pieces falls into the black hole, and the other piece steals some of the black hole's rotational energy. This can also be seen with sound waves. When twisted sound waves are reflected off of a rotating metal rod, they become rotationally Doppler shifted. This causes the waves to obtain a negative frequency, and be amplified. A similar concept can be used with rotating black holes. By shooting a rocket into the ergosphere, and then detaching the boosters, the boosters fall into the black hole while the rocket leaves with some of the black hole's rotational energy. An advanced civilisation would probably build a mirror around a black hole. For a black hole with the mass of the sun, we would need only the resources of a large asteroid for a ten centimetre thick mirror. By shooting twisted electromagnetic waves inside, some of the electromagnetic waves get gobbled up by the black hole, while most of them get amplified. By opening up the mirror, the electromagnetic waves have much more energy than prior. If you don’t open up the mirror, the electromagnetic waves continue to amplify, to the point where they supernova. The black hole bomb is the largest explosion any living being could make.</p>
    
    <p class="conclusion">Black holes are the largest mystery in the universe. Remember, I’m just some random middle schooler, so make sure to do your own research. I’m Kmitav Arishna, and have a nice day.</p>
