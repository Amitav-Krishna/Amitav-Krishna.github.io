        When you look at ants, you might not think theyâ€™re very intelligent.<br> However, ants build massive colonies spanning many miles, and wage brutal wars against other colonies.<br> The backbone to their success is their intricate system of communication.<br> In this blog post, I will tell you about just how complicated formic communication is.

    </p>
    <p> <img src = "https://romneypestcontrol.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/selective-focus-of-red-ants-on-wooden-pavement.jpg" alt = "Selective focus of red ants on wooden pavement" style = "float:right">
       The first type of formic communication and the most well known one are pheromones.<br> Pheromones are secreted or excreted chemicals released by ants (and other insects) that can communicate lots of different things.<br> Other ants pick up these pheromones using their antenna.<br> Alarm pheromones can be used when an ant colony is being invaded, while trail pheromones are used to communicate the location of food.<br> Pheromones are also used to identify different ants.<br> They can be used to distinguish different types of ant (Soldiers vs. Workers) or different colonies (Friend vs. Foe).<br> Even though this is a very reliable system, it is still failable.<br> Ant death mills happen when ants are following each other, and the ant at the front has to make a slight deviation from its path (Such as to avoid a rock).<br> When this happens, this can lead to the ants going around in circles, following the pheromones, until they die from exhaustion.<br><br>
        While pheromone communication makes up the bulk of ant communication, there are other methods of communication.<br> Ants also communicate through touching. For the longest time we believed that antennae were only used as a sensory organ, however a study from the University of Melbourne revealed that antennae were two-way communicators.<br> Cuticular hydro-carbons (CHCs) are a chemical that covers the body of an ant (as well as other insects such as bees and flies).<br> It was originally thought that the use of CHCs were just to keep the animals from dehydration, however now we know that they are also essential to ant communication.<br> When researchers removed the CHCs from the antennae, her opponents could not recognise her colony identity.<br> There was also a famous experiment 125 years ago by entomologist Auguste Forel where he completely removed the antennae of 4 different species of ants.<br> Instead of fighting each other, they simply huddled together peacefully.<br><br>Another way that ants communicate is through sight. While not as advanced as other animals, ants still use their eyesight for communication.<br> Changes in posture can be used to signify obedience and many nests use landmarks for navigation.<br> However they mostly navigate through touch and smell.<br><br>

The final way that ants communicate is through sound.<br> They can make sound through a process called stridulation that involves them rubbing certain body parts together (similar to rubbing your finger on the teeth of a comb).<br> These sounds can be used to attract mates, convey information, or alert others of danger.<br> Other ants can detect these sounds with their antennae and react accordingly.<br><br>

        Ants are very fascinating creatures with extremely complex social structures, and we are just scratching the surface of their intricate behaviour.<br> This has been Amitav Krishna, and thank you for reading this blog.
